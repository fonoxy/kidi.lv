This is a copy of the latvian kids games and learning website.

I have revived it because as of adobe shutting down flash on the 31 of December 2020 unless you have had any flash player installed you werent able to access this website.

In the [link.html](https://github.com/fonoxy/KiDi.lv/tree/master/links.html) file some of the non latvian and some of the non working links have only been commented out to preserve the history of the website as it is older than 10 years.

**DO NOT** email info@kidi.lv as I don't think this email works and if anything goes wrong try to get in contact with me.

Mana Spēļu Kaste will be added hopefully aswell
